Welcome to CottageConnects!  Use it to buy or sell things, to let your cottage neighbors know of upcoming events, to ask for recommendations (and to make them), or to start a conversation. To post a message, simply send an email to cottageconnects@gmail.com. Your email, subject line, and the entirety of your message will be posted.

Each day, you will receive an email with the posts since the last email.  If you want to post something, do not hit “reply”,  but start a new email.  If you no longer want to be a part of CottageConnects, send an email to CottageConnects.unsubscribe@gmail.com, and put “unsubscribe” in the subject line.

Remember: invite your friends to join!  Since we no longer use CB radios, this is a way to stay in touch!
